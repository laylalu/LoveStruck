    <string name="about_app_string">Yes – this app does exactly what you think! Love Struck gives you the power of Cupid, right on your phone. Want that hottie over there to fall head over heals for you? No problem! Just turn on Love Struck and watch the app in action. Love Struck uses audio vibrations specifically tailored to trigger areas the brain associated with love, sex, and attraction.\n
        \nLove Struck is completely idiot proof. If you want to attract a girl – you push the girl button and hit play. If you want to attract a boy – you push the boy button and hit play. If you want the app to work in the background, non-stop – push repeat. It doesn’t matter how loud or low your volume setting is. That’s it! In a loud room? No problem. Love Struck works subconsciously, like pheromones. Even in a bumpin’ bar, all the brains near you will be zapped by Love Struck.\n
        \nkeptical? We tested Love Struck vigorously with beta testers of different genders and ages and the results are in - Love Struck works! While it won’t turn those around you into a herd of mindless zombies, all our beta-testers reported that they absolutely got more attention while using Love Struck. One of our beta testers even said “When I turned it on it was like a crazy frenzy of emotions coming from the guys next to me. It was like – bam!”\n
        \nUse Love Struck in school to get your crush sitting next to you pay a little more attention to you. Use it in the bar when you’re about to walk over and try out your latest pickup line. Use it when she’s over at your apartment and you want a little “extra help.” :)\n
        \nGuys, if you are on a date and have Love Struck on, but are eating some huge, messy sandwich and get lots of junk stuck between your teeth – there’s no app that can fix that. Same goes for you, girls. You still have to do what you do – look the part. While Love Struck is not designed to override everything else and force someone to fall in love with you, it is absolutely the most powerful tool that you can use to make people near you get crazy attracted to you.\n
        \nEveryone – by using Love Struck you are promising to use this app only for good – and never for evil!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</string>

    <string name="how_it_works_string">We developed Love Struck to help people get that extra “bam!” power to attract. We all know that certain things attract and un-attract people from one another. For the most part, we’re attracted to others by what we see, what we smell and what we hear.\n\n
        Sight\nFor instance, the way a person looks or dresses can attract. Ever wonder how it is that you think someone’s face is crazy gorgeous, but your best friend just doesn’t see it? A person’s facial structure – even certain types of clothing may appeal to one girl or guy, but look ugly to another.\n\n
        Smell\nCertain perfumes or colognes can smell amazing on a person, or they can reek of disgust. Some girls are attracted to one guy’s sweat after a hard workout at the gym, but some other guy’s sweat smell will send her packing to the bathroom to puke one out.\n\n
        Sound\nA girl or guy’s voice can attract too. Guys – you ever speak to a girl whose voice makes you crazy attracted and you have no idea why? Girls – you ever talk to a guy and completely forget what he’s saying because his voice made you imagine what it would feel like if he just pushed you up against the wall and kissed you? That’s not by accident. It’s how our bodies work. Everybody’s senses are different. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but the truth is, beauty is in the eye, nose and ear of the beholder!\n
        \nLove Struck works by attracting people near you using the power of sound. Just like a person’s voice can attract, so can certain sounds. These sounds don’t have to be able to be heard by you – just by your brain. You know you can’t hear the sound of a dog whistle, but a dog can hear the dog whistle? Think of Love Struck like that. It’s not meant for your ears – it’s made for your brain. Certain sounds can actually affect the way your brain chemistry works, and Love Struck works on that level, behind the scenes, helping you to attract.\n\n
        If you’re really interested in all the science behind it, like our Facebook Page and read all about it! We didn’t want to stick long pages and pages of sciency sounding stuff here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</string>
